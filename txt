### *Introduction (30 seconds)*
"Hi, I'm [Your Name], and today I'm demonstrating my medical chatbot project - a full-stack abdominal pain symptom assessment system. This project showcases my skills in React, FastAPI, PyTorch, and database design. I built this entirely from scratch to demonstrate my understanding of modern web development and AI integration."

---

[1. Dataset & Goal]

The goal is to build a chatbot that can understand a user‚Äôs intent ‚Äî like greetings, medical symptoms, or asking for help ‚Äî and respond accordingly.

The data is loaded from an intents.json file, which contains several tags like "greeting" or "symptom", each with example phrases and responses.

[2. Preprocessing]

First, I tokenize and stem each sentence using NLTK‚Äôs PorterStemmer, which helps reduce word variations ‚Äî like turning ‚Äúrunning‚Äù into ‚Äúrun.‚Äù

Then, I create a vocabulary of all unique stemmed words and convert each sentence into a sequence of numbers, based on this vocabulary.

To standardize the input length, I pad each sequence to 32 tokens using a special <PAD> token.

[3. Transformer Model]

I built a Transformer-based classifier using PyTorch. Here‚Äôs what it includes:

Embedding Layer: Converts word indices into vector representations.

Positional Encoding: Adds sequence information to the embeddings.

Transformer Encoder: A multi-layer self-attention mechanism to learn context.

Classification Head: It averages the output sequence and passes it through a linear layer to predict the correct intent tag.

This model is trained using CrossEntropyLoss and AdamW optimizer, with gradient clipping for stability.

[4. Training]

The model is trained for 1000 epochs with a batch size of 8. Every 100 epochs, I log the loss to track progress.

Once training is complete, I save the model weights, vocabulary, tags, and hyperparameters in a .pth file so it can be reused for inference.

[5. Inference / Chatbot Interface]

In inference mode, the chatbot accepts user input, tokenizes and encodes it, and then predicts the intent using the trained model.

If the model‚Äôs confidence is above a threshold, it picks a response from the corresponding tag. Otherwise, it responds with a fallback message.

Here‚Äôs an example:

If the user types "hello," the model might classify it under "greeting" and respond with ‚ÄúHi there, how can I help?‚Äù

[Conclusion]

This chatbot shows how we can combine NLP techniques and Transformer-based models for real-world conversational systems. The architecture is scalable, customizable, and can be extended for domains like healthcare, customer support, or personal assistants.

Thank you for watching!f

---

### *2. Frontend Deep Dive (3 minutes)*

*"Let's examine the React frontend. I chose JavaScript over TypeScript for rapid prototyping, but I understand TypeScript's benefits for type safety."*

[Open App.js]

*"Key Technical Decisions:"*

*State Management*: 
javascript
const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);
const [step, setStep] = useState('greet'); // Multi-step onboarding
const [conversationContext, setConversationContext] = useState({});


*"I implemented a sophisticated state management system using React hooks. The app maintains conversation state, user context, and multi-step onboarding flow."*

*Conversation Flow Architecture*:
javascript
// Three-step onboarding process
if (step === 'name') {
  setUserName(inputMessage);
  setStep('age');
} else if (step === 'age') {
  setUserAge(inputMessage);
  setStep('chat');
}


*"This ensures proper user onboarding before medical assessment."*

*Real-time Communication*:
javascript
const response = await axios.post('http://localhost:8000/chat', {
  message: inputMessage,
  session_id: sessionId,
  user_name: userName,
  user_age: userAge,
  conversation_context: conversationContext
});


*"I implemented proper error handling and loading states for professional UX."*

---

### *3. Backend API Design (2.5 minutes)*

*"The backend uses FastAPI for high performance and automatic API documentation."*

[Open main.py]

*"API Architecture:"*
python
app = FastAPI(
    title="Abdominal Pain Symptom Checker Chatbot",
    description="chatbot for abdominal pain symptom checking using PyTorch",
    version="1.0.0"
)


*"I implemented proper CORS configuration for frontend-backend communication:"*
python
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["http://localhost:3000"],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)


[Open chat.py]

*"The chat endpoint demonstrates my understanding of async programming and database integration:"*
python
@router.post("/chat", response_model=ConversationResponse)
async def chat(request: ConversationRequest, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    # AI processing
    response, is_symptom_related = chatbot_service.generate_response(request.message)
    
    # Database persistence
    conversation = Conversation(
        session_id=request.session_id,
        user_message=request.message,
        bot_response=response,
        is_symptom_related=is_symptom_related
    )
    db.add(conversation)
    db.commit()


*"I designed the API to be RESTful with proper HTTP status codes and error handling."*

---

### *4. Database Design (1.5 minutes)*

*"For data persistence, I chose SQLite with SQLAlchemy ORM for simplicity and reliability."*

[Open database.py]

python
class Conversation(Base):
    __tablename__ = "conversations"
    
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    session_id = Column(String, index=True)
    user_message = Column(Text)
    bot_response = Column(Text)
    timestamp = Column(DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow)
    is_symptom_related = Column(Boolean, default=True)
    conversation_data = Column(JSON, nullable=True)


*"I designed the schema to support conversation history, session management, and metadata storage. The JSON column allows flexible conversation context storage."*

---

### *5. AI/ML Implementation (3 minutes)*

*"The core intelligence comes from a custom PyTorch Transformer model I trained specifically for medical intent classification."*

[Open bot.py]

*"Model Architecture:"*
python
class TransformerClassifier(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, vocab_size, embed_dim, num_heads, num_encoder_layers, ff_dim, output_size):
        super().__init__()
        self.embedding = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, embed_dim)
        self.pos_encoder = PositionalEncoding(embed_dim)
        encoder_layer = nn.TransformerEncoderLayer(d_model=embed_dim, nhead=num_heads)
        self.transformer_encoder = nn.TransformerEncoder(encoder_layer, num_layers=num_encoder_layers)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(embed_dim, output_size)


*"I implemented a state-of-the-art Transformer architecture with:*
- *Positional Encoding*: Maintains sequence order
- *Multi-head Attention*: Captures complex relationships
- *Feed-forward Networks*: Non-linear transformations
- *Layer Normalization*: Training stability"

*Intent Classification Pipeline:*
python
def predict_intents_with_scores(self, message: str) -> List[Tuple[str, float]]:
    tokenized_sentence = self.tokenize(message)
    numerical_sequence = [self.word_to_idx.get(w, 0) for w in tokenized_sentence]
    X = torch.tensor(numerical_sequence).unsqueeze(0)
    
    with torch.no_grad():
        output = self.model(X)
    probs = torch.softmax(output, dim=1)
    return self.get_top_predictions(probs)


*"The model provides confidence scores and can handle multiple intent interpretations simultaneously."*

### *6. Training Data & Medical Knowledge (1.5 minutes)*

*"I created a comprehensive medical knowledge base in JSON format."*

[Open intents.json]

json
{
  "tag": "abdominal_pain_location",
  "patterns": ["pain in my stomach", "hurts in abdomen"],
  "response": ["Where exactly is the pain located? Upper, lower, left, or right side?"]
}


*"I structured the data with:*
- *Intent Tags*: Medical categories
- *Pattern Matching*: Common symptom descriptions
- *Medical Responses*: Professional, safe guidance
- *Safety Protocols*: Always recommend professional consultation"

---

### *7. TypeScript Consideration (1 minute)*

*"Regarding the TypeScript requirement: I chose JavaScript for rapid development, but I understand TypeScript's benefits. Here's how I would implement it:"*

typescript
// Type definitions I would add
interface ConversationRequest {
  message: string;
  session_id: string;
  user_name: string;
  user_age: string;
  conversation_context: Record<string, any>;
}

interface Message {
  id: number;
  text: string;
  isUser: boolean;
  timestamp: Date;
}

// Type-safe state management
const [messages, setMessages] = useState<Message[]>([]);
const [step, setStep] = useState<'greet' | 'name' | 'age' | 'chat'>('greet');


*"TypeScript would provide:*
- *Type Safety*: Catch errors at compile time
